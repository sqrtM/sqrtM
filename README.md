lots of php, typescript, react, and all the other basic web stuff. most of my bigger stuff and passion projects i do in java. i also play around with livecoding audio-visual languages and their associated environments a lot, like tidalcycles and hydra+three.js. i also use C sometimes to program for weird operating systems.

working mostly on rust + wasm
